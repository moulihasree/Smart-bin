# Smart-bin
     This bin can detect the level of harmful gasess released from the waste and notify the users beforehand 
     to dispose the waste from the bin. 
     This will be achieved by estimating the day of gas release beforehand with the knowledge of ambient
     temperature, pressure and current gas range inside the bin using the environmental sensor BME688.
