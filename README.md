# Smart-bin
##Problem:
The undisposed waste in our homes eventually starts to decompose after a few days and releases harmful gases like methane, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, etc. 
When these gases are inhaled by us it causes headache, mood swing, breathing problems, lung disease, etc.

## Solution:
To build a Smart-bin that tracks the air quality in it and waste level, and notifies the user via a mobile app to dispose the waste once the air gets polluted or when the bin is full.
The Smart-bin will also be helpful for the people with smell disorders like Anosmia and Hyposmia.

## Mobile app features:
* Display the Index of air quality (IAQ) in the bin.
* Display the waste level.

## Optional features:
Estimating the air quality beforehand with the knowledge of previous ambient temperature, pressure and air quality inside the bin using the environmental sensor BME688.

## WORKFLOW:
STEP 1: Collect BME688 sensor data from 4 different dustbins.
STEP 2: Mapping the number of days required for hazardous gas release from the bin with temperature and pressure data.
STEP 3: User notification about the status of the bin(Currently OLED to display the status of the bin). 
STEP 4: Final Prototype.

## TIME PLAN:
WEEK 1: Interfacing the gas and temperature sensors with the microcontroller
WEEK 2: Collecting the gas and temperature sensor data from the 4 dustbins
WEEK 3:
WEEK 4:
WEEK 5:
WEEK 6:
WEEK 7:
WEEK 8: Final prototype
